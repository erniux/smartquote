This code is related to a Django REST API for managing quotations and their associated sales. Here's a brief explanation of the components:

1. **models.py**: Contains the models for Quotation, QuotationItem, QuotationExpense, Sale, and User. These define the database schema for the application.

2. **serializers.py**: Defines the serialization classes for the models. Serialization is essential to convert Python objects into JSON format that can be sent over HTTP.

3. **views.py**: Contains viewsets that handle creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting quotations, sales, and related data. The QuotationViewSet has actions like generate_sale, duplicate, and cancel to perform specific operations on the quotations.

4. **permissions.py**: Defines custom permissions for controlling access to certain resources. Here we have QuotationPermission that ensures only users with manager or admin role can perform certain actions on quotations.

5. **filter_backends.py**: Contains the filter classes used in views to filter and sort querysets based on specified fields.

6. **urls.py**: Defines the URL patterns for the application, mapping each view to a specific URL.
