This code is part of a Django REST Framework project for managing quotations and sales in a company. It defines several classes, functions, and actions related to quotations:

1. `models.py`: Defines the Quotation, Sale, QuotationItem, and QuotationExpense models with their fields and relationships.

2. `serializers.py`: Contains the serializers for the Quotation, QuotationItem, and QuotationExpense models to convert them into Python data structures that can be easily transferred over HTTP.

3. `views.py`: Defines the QuotationViewSet viewset which handles requests related to quotations, such as listing, retrieving a single quotation, creating a new one, generating a sale from a quotation, duplicating a quotation, and canceling a quotation. The viewset also includes permissions based on the user's role in the company (admin, manager, support, or regular member).

4. `urls.py`: Defines the URL patterns for handling requests related to quotations, including the QuotationViewSet.

The code demonstrates good practices for building a RESTful API with Django and Django REST Framework, such as using model serializers, generic viewsets, permission classes, filtering, searching, and actions. It also uses transactions when creating new records to ensure data consistency.
